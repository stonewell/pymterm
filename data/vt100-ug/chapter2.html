<H1 ID="S2">Chapter 2<BR>Installation, Interface Information and Specifications</H1>
<H2 ID="S2.1">Installation</H2>
<H3 ID="S2.1.1">Site Considerations</H3>
<P>The design of the VT100 terminal (<A HREF="figure2-1.html">Figure&nbsp;2-1</A>) will normally pose few constraints
on selecting a place in which to install the terminal. In most cases, any environment
suitable to the terminal operator will be a satisfactory environment in which
to operate the terminal. Extremes of temperature and humidity should be avoided.
A summary of VT100 guaranteed operating conditions is found at the end of this
section.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.1.2">Unpacking and Maintenance</H3>
<P>The VT100 shipping carton contains the following items:</P>
<UL>
<LI>VT100 monitor</LI>
<LI>VT100 detached keyboard</LI>
<LI>VT100 power cord</LI>
<LI>VT100 SET-UP label</LI>
<LI>VT100 User's Guide</LI>
</UL>
<P>To install the VT100 perform the following steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Remove the VT100 from the shipping carton and place it in the desired
work area.</LI>
<LI>Place the keyboard in front of the terminal and plug the keyboard coiled
cord into the keyboard receptacle located on the rear of the terminal
(<A HREF="figure2-2.html">Figure&nbsp;2-2</A>).</LI>
<LI>Verify that the power selector switch shows the correct wall outlet
voltage (115&nbsp;V is standard in the U.S.) and the power switch is off.</LI>
<LI>Connect the power cord to the power cord receptacle on the rear of the
terminal and plug the other end of the power cord into a nearby wall
outlet.</LI>
<LI>Connect the communications cable to the appropriate communications
receptacle.</LI>
<LI>Turn the power switch on. The terminal will now automatically perform
the power-up self-test and either the ON LINE or LOCAL light located
on the keyboard will be turned on. After approximately one minute the
cursor will be visible in the upper-left corner of the screen. If any other
indication is shown, refer to Part 5 of the operator information chapter.</LI>
<LI>Set the desired SET-UP features as outlined in the operator's section of
this manual.</LI>
<LI>Once the installation setup procedure is complete, record the SET-UP
features selected on the VT100 SET-UP label and attach the label to
the underside of the keyboard.</LI>
</OL>
<H3 ID="S2.1.3">User Maintenance</H3>
<P>The keyboard keys are the only moving parts of the terminal and require no preventive
maintenance by the owner. The VT100 surfaces may be cleaned with soap
and water or any mild detergent. Cleaners with solvents should not be used.</P>
<P>The VT100 packaging is not meant to be weatherproof; there are several openings
in the case through which liquids, coins, paper clips, and other objects can fall.
Such objects would disturb the electronic operation of the terminal if they came
into contact with the circuitry. For this reason, avoid putting drinks and metal
objects on the top of the terminal, or using excessive water to clean the terminal.
Rubbing the keys with a dry or barely moist cloth should suffice to clean them. Do
not remove the keycaps to clean them more thoroughly; damage may result to the
switch contacts if they are replaced incorrectly.</P>
<P>Keep the ventilation slots clear. Blocking these slots by placing objects on top of or
under the VT100 may cause the terminal to overheat.</P>
<H2 ID="S2.2">Interface Information</H2>
<H3 ID="S2.2.1">EIA Interface</H3>
<P>The basic VT100 operates on full duplex, asynchronous communication lines. The
terminal interfaces to the line with a 25-pin connector mounted on the back of the
terminal which meets the requirements of EIA specification RS-232-C. <A HREF="table2-1.html">Table&nbsp;2-1</A>
summarizes the EIA connector signals; the following paragraphs explain each signal
as used in the basic VT100.</P>
<P><STRONG>Protective Ground -- Pin 1</STRONG><BR>
This conductor is electrically bonded to the VT100 chassis. Use of this conductor
for reference potential purposes is not allowed.</P>
<P><STRONG>Transmitted Data (from VT100) -- Pin 2</STRONG><BR>
The VT100 transmits serially encoded characters and break signals on this circuit,
which is held in the mark state when neither characters nor break signals are being
transmitted.</P>
<P><STRONG>Received Data (to VT100) -- Pin 3</STRONG><BR>
The VT100 receives serially encoded characters generated by the user's equipment
on this circuit.</P>
<P><STRONG>Request to Send (from VT100) -- Pin 4</STRONG><BR>
Asserted at all times when terminal is powered up.</P>
<P><STRONG>Clear to Send (to VT100) -- Pin 5</STRONG><BR>
Ignored at all times.</P>
<P><STRONG>Data Set Ready (to VT100) -- Pin 6</STRONG><BR>
Ignored at all times.</P>
<P><STRONG>Signal Ground -- Pin 7</STRONG><BR>
This conductor establishes the common ground reference potential for all voltages
on the interface. It is permanently connected to the VT100 chassis.</P>
<P><STRONG>Carrier Detect (to VT100) -- Pin 8</STRONG><BR>
Ignored at all times.</P>
<P><STRONG>Speed Select (from VT100) -- Pins 11, 19, and 23</STRONG><BR>
This signal is alternately called Secondary Request to Send. The basic VT100
maintains this line in the asserted state at all times.</P>
<P><STRONG>Speed Indicator (to VT100) -- Pin 12</STRONG><BR>
This signal, alternately called Secondary Carrier Detect, is ignored at all times.</P>
<P><STRONG>Transmission Clock (to VT100) -- Pin 15</STRONG><BR>
Ignored at all times.</P>
<P><STRONG>Receive Clock (to VT100) -- Pin 17</STRONG><BR>
Ignored at all times.</P>
<P><STRONG>Data Terminal Ready (from VT100) -- Pin 20</STRONG><BR>
Data Terminal Ready is asserted at all times except under the following conditions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Terminal is not powered up</LI>
<LI>Terminal is in LOCAL mode</LI>
<LI>The 3.5 second interval following the pressing of <SPAN CLASS="keyname">SHIFT</SPAN>-<SPAN CLASS="keyname">BREAK</SPAN>.</LI>
</OL>
<P><STRONG>Ring Indicator (to VT100) -- Pin 22</STRONG><BR>
Ignored at all times.</P>
<H4 ID="S2.2.1.1">Electrical Characteristics</H4>
<P><STRONG>VT100 Output Voltages</STRONG> -- On signals designated "from VT100", the mark, or
unasserted state, is -6.0&nbsp;V to -12.0&nbsp;V; the space, or asserted state, is +6.0&nbsp;V
to +12.0&nbsp;V.</P>
<P><STRONG>VT100 Input Voltages</STRONG> -- On signals designated "to VT100", -25.0&nbsp;V to +0.75&nbsp;V
or an open circuit is interpreted as a mark or unasserted state, and +25.0&nbsp;V to
+2.25&nbsp;V is interpreted as a space or asserted state. Voltages greater in magnitude
than &plusmn;25&nbsp;V are not allowed. These levels are compatible with EIA STD RS-232-C
and CCITT Recommendation V.28.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.2.2">Optional 20&nbsp;mA Current Loop Interface</H3>
<P>In most current loop applications, the VT100 will be connected in a passive configuration
-- that is, current is supplied to the VT100. In this mode, the transmitter
and receiver are both passive, both optically isolated, and the transmitter goes to
the mark state when power is turned off.</P>
<P>Conversion from active to passive (or vice versa) requires moving a slide switch.</P>
<P>In active mode either the transmitter or the receiver or both may be connected so
that the VT100 sources the 20&nbsp;mA of current. In active mode isolation is not
present and the transmitter will go to the space state when power to the VT100 is
turned off.</P>
<P><A HREF="figure2-3.html">Figure&nbsp;2-3</A> shows the 20&nbsp;mA current loop interface connector mounted to the
access cover and the individual pin assignment.</P>
<P><STRONG>Electrical Characteristics</STRONG><BR>
The electrical characteristics of the 20&nbsp;mA current loop interface are shown below:</P>

<P>In addition to the above specifications for passive operation, active mode will place
the transmitter or receiver in series with a source of 17&nbsp;V &plusmn;5 percent and 660
ohms.</P>
<H3 ID="S2.2.3">External Video Connections</H3>
<P>In addition to the EIA interface, the VT100 is also capable of easily interfacing to
external video devices. The video devices may act either as a slave to the VT100
when connected to the composite video output or provide synchronized video to
the VT100 video section when connected to the video input. The external video
connectors are the two female BNC connectors located on the back of the terminal
just below the EIA connector. The upper connector, J8, is the video input while the
lower connector, J9, is the video output.</P>
<P><STRONG>Composite Video Output (J9)</STRONG><BR>
The composite video output provides RS170-like output (see note) generated by
combining the video signal with a composite sync signal. This output contains all
video data appearing on the VT100 screen except that video which comes from
J8. The output has the following nominal characteristics. (Refer to <A HREF="figure2-4.html">Figure&nbsp;2-4</A>).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Output impedance = 75 ohms, dc-coupled</LI>
<LI>Sync level = 0&nbsp;V</LI>
<LI>Black level = approximately 0.3&nbsp;V when loaded with 75 ohms</LI>
<LI>White level = approximately 1.0&nbsp;V with a 75 ohm load</LI>
<LI>The composite sync waveform conforms to EIA RS170 standards. The
vertical interval is composed of six equalizing pulses, six vertical sync
pulses, and six more equalizing pulses. The timing is as follows:

</TBODY>
</TABLE></LI>
</OL>
<P CLASS="note">NOTE: The use of dc-coupling is not in strict agreement
with RS170. To agree with RS170 the output load requires a 10&micro;F
capacitor in series with the output. Failing to do so, the 2&nbsp;mA dc
short circuit current requirement is violated. This presents no problem
with most monitors which are in fact ac-coupled.</P>
<P><STRONG>Video Input (J8)</STRONG><BR>
An analog signal applied to the video input will be "ORed" with the internal video
signal in such a way that the beam intensity at any point on the screen will
correspond to the intensity of that signal which would tend to make the beam
brighter at that point. A video signal on this input affects only the internal screen and
does not appear on the composite video output. This input has the following nominal
characteristics.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Input impedance = 75 ohms, dc-coupled</LI>
<LI>Black level = 0 V</LI>
<LI>White level = 1.0 V</LI>
<LI>Maximum continuous input = &plusmn;2.0 V</LI>
</OL>
<P>The external video source must be synchronized to the VT100; it may do this by
referencing the composite sync on the composite video output. This means that
the VT100 video input will not synchronize with any composite video source including
the composite video output of another VT100.</P>
